"""IMAPClient wrapper for read operations.

Stateless, per-call connection lifecycle. This module is deliberately
unaware of Mail.app, Keychain, and the MCP server. It takes fully-
resolved credentials and talks IMAP. Callers (tests here; the
delegation layer in #40 later) are responsible for correlating
Mail.app account name → (host, port, email) and fetching the
password via ``keychain.get_imap_password``.

See ``docs/plans/2026-04-23-imap-connector-design.md``.
